## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ”¥ **Real-Time Decentralized Retrieval**: Built with Akave SDK for low-latency access to datasets, model weights, and inference outputs.
- ðŸ”— **Interoperable Storage Bridge**: Connects decentralized data storage to cloud-native AI tools.
- ðŸ’¸ **On-Chain Monetization**: Smart contracts manage access control and secure transactions for buying/renting AI models or data.
- ðŸ§  **AI-Friendly Indexing**: Automatic indexing of datasets for seamless integration with ML pipelines.
- ðŸ”’ **Permissioned Access**: Ensure that purchased/rented assets can't be replicated or accessed without authorization.

## ðŸ“¦ Architecture

1. **Akave Node** â€” for hot retrieval layer.
2. **Smart Contract Layer** â€” handles marketplace listings, access rights, and payment flows.
3. **Frontend** â€” user dashboard to upload, browse, rent/buy datasets and models.
4. **Backend** â€” Akave SDK wrapper + indexing services.
